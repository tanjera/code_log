Code Blue Log: For paramedical, medical, and nursing professionals, to assist with timekeeping and informally recording events during resuscitation (code blue) events.

Primarily intended to be used as a high-tech note-taking tool during emergency resusctiations, transports, and responses, with build-in stopwatches to assist with timekeeping and a dynamic event log to assist with recording tasks. Similar to the functionality built into the Lifepak and Zoll defibrillators, the Code Blue Log builds on this functionality by adding more stopwatches for BLS & ACLS events that require accurate timing, and an extensive but easily-navigable library of drugs, events, cardiac rhythms, and procedures that can be annoted to the on the event log quickly and easily.

Multiple screenshots are included in the following feature image, including:
- The main recorder functionality (left) with multiple stopwatches for key BLS & ACLS events.
- A list of drugs that can be recorded into the event log
- A list of cardiac rhythms that can be documented in the event log
- A list of general events that can be recorded in the event log
